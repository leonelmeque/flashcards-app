# Flashcards Mobile App
The idea of the app is to create decks that includes a quiz with different cards that contain questons about a specific topic.
The app lets you create a deck that later you can add cards, inside each card there's a question and the correct answer, once that student enters the quiz section of the deck it will respond the question and then click on show answer to see if it was correct or not, if the question is correct the student will click on the correct button, if its not it will click on the wrong answer button.
After he/she finishes answering the quiz the app will tell show the score of the user.

# Technology Used
This mobile app was developed using VScode, React Native & Expo, the app was also tested using the Expo Client on a Apple device (Iphone 7 plus) and tested using the Expo Client on a Android device (Samsung A10s).

# How to install the app
First make sure you have:
1. Expo-Cli
2. Android Studio (if you want to run on a emulator)
3. Android SDK
4. VScode
5. yarn or npm

Once you make sure you have all of those installed run: `npm install` that will install all the dependencies needed for you to run the project. After all dependecies are installed, run `npm start` and you will see the expo-cli run.

If you have a smartphone It would be good if you download the Expo app in the App Store or Google Play Store.
